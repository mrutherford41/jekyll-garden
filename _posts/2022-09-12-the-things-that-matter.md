life can get needlessly complicated so here are some things to remind myself of what I truly care about:

- appreciating and creating as much music as i can
- being in the presence of falling rain
- taking time to gaze at the clouds and stars
- cooking with love
- spending moments doing ordinary things
- sharing it all
